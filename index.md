## Understanding the limits of Quantum Theory, Algorithms and Systems

Our research group, comprised of dedicated CS and ECE students and esteemed faculty, is at the forefront of exploring groundbreaking advancements in quantum optimization and algorithms. Our work delves into the complexities and potential of quantum linear systems of equations problems, Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs), and other cutting-edge techniques. By leveraging quantum computing's and quantum systems' unique capabilities, we aim to solve computational problems that are currently solvable by classical systems but rather inefficiently, thereby pushing the boundaries of what's possible in computer science and practical applications.

Through rigorous research and collaboration, we strive to contribute to the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing. Our projects are designed not only to advance theoretical understanding but also to develop solutions that can be applied across various domains. We invite you to explore our website to learn more about our initiatives, ongoing projects, and the impact of our research. Join us on this exciting journey as we unlock new dimensions of computing and pave the way for future innovations in technology and science.
